## Welcome
Hi, I am Ales

As a student who possesses a fervent enthusiasm for web design, my ultimate aspiration is to specialize as a front-end developer. Nonetheless, my curiosity and eagerness to acquire new knowledge and skills keep me open-minded to other opportunities that may arise. At present, I am actively seeking part-time employment, wherein I can apply and further enhance my existing competencies while gaining valuable industry experience.
